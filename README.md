# B4B App Project

-Ironhack Web Development PT Madrid 04/2020
-Module 3 Final Project: Full Stack MERN Web Application

The app must:

-Use React for all of the user-facing parts of your application.
-Use Express for your API backend that your React app will communicate with.
-Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
-Have 3 models or more.
-Having one for users is a no-brainer.
-The other two should represent the main functionality of your app.
-Don’t force it if having a 3rd model doesn’t make sense.
-Have validation on its models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
-Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
-Have two repos on GitHub. One for your React application and the other for your Express API backend.
-Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
-Be deployed online using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.
-Responsive design is not a requirement.

Updated Deliverables

-A working MERN stack application, built by you that runs on a server.
-A deploy of your app on Heroku.
-The two URLs of your GitHub repositories (React & Express).
-The URL of the React app.
-The URL of the slides for your app’s presentation.
-Your GitHub repos should have the URL of your live app in the URL section.
-You must present your app during Project #3 final presentations (last day of Project #3 time).
